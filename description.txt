12DAYS WEB APPLICATION - COMPREHENSIVE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
12Days is a seasonal web application providing 12 daily creative challenges from a customizable start date (default December 13th). Users create or join themed game instances, complete time-based challenges with speed bonuses, earn virtual currency (jingle bells), and unlock cosmetics through a present system. The app features a comprehensive theme system for visual customization and supports multiple challenge types with anti-cheat measures.

CORE ARCHITECTURE
=================

Technology Stack:
- Frontend: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Backend: AWS Amplify Gen 2 with Lambda functions  
- Database: DynamoDB single-table design with efficient query patterns
- Authentication: AWS Cognito with email verification
- Storage: S3 for photo challenge uploads
- Hosting: AWS Amplify Hosting
- Region: us-west-2

Data Architecture:
- Extended single-table DynamoDB design for cost efficiency
- PK/SK patterns optimized for minimal RCU/WCU consumption
- Theme-ready structure supporting unlimited visual customizations
- Legacy 2024 data fully migrated and preserved
- Content tracking system to prevent challenge repeats

THEME SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
==========================
CSS-Based Theme Engine:

- Root element gets `theme-{themeName}` class from game metadata
- Theme-specific assets (backgrounds, sounds, icons) loaded conditionally
- Instant theme switching via database value changes
- Secret themes accessible only via database manipulation

Theme Categories:
- Standard Themes: Christmas, Halloween, Fourth of July
- Secret Themes: Matrix, Developer, Debug modes

- Admin Themes: Special styling with enhanced admin tool visibility

Implementation Structure:
```css
.theme-christmas .bg-primary { background: #dc2626; }
.theme-halloween .bg-primary { background: #f97316; }
.theme-matrix .bg-primary { background: #00ff00; }
```
